# Leetcode Category Exams

![Under Construction](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under_construction-yellow)

This repository provides a structured exam environment for practicing Leetcode problems, inspired by the **Leetcode Interview 150 Problem Set**.

---

## Resources

- [Leetcode Interview 150 Problem Set](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/)
- [Repository of My Solutions](https://github.com/chitangchin/LeetCodeInterview150)

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create an exam-like environment for each Leetcode category, helping users practice efficiently under realistic constraints. Each category includes:

- **Time Limits**: Simulate real-time coding challenges.
- **Unique Unit Tests**: Ensure each solution passes multiple test cases.
- **Minimal Setup**: No complicated environment configuration is needed to start solving problems.

## How to Practice

Once the project is complete, you can begin studying by focusing on a specific category of problems. Here’s the process:

### Steps to Start Practicing:

1. **Navigate to the Desired Category**: For example, the category "ArrayString."
   
2. **Create a New Git Branch**: Before starting, check out to a new branch with the following naming convention:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b 9-5-2024ArrayString
    ```
- **Branch Name Format**: `month-day-yearCategory`
- Example: `9-5-2024ArrayString`

3. **Complete Within Time Limit**: Each category will have a designated time limit for completing the problems. Check the README file of the specific category for the time constraints.

## Categories

The categories align with the topics in the **Leetcode Interview 150** problem set. Each category has a dedicated folder with the following:

- **Problem Set**: A list of problems from Leetcode for the category.
- **README**: Instructions, time limits, and problem descriptions for the category.
- **Unit Tests**: Pre-built tests to validate your solutions.
